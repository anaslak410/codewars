My solutions to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) katas lie here. They can also be found on my CodeWars profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/spicyboi).

Note that the smaller the "kyu" number is the harder the kata is to solve.

## Important!

Please, do not use my solutions to solve your own katas. This repo is here for me to log and showcase my technical skills. don't go for shortcuts. Do the hardwork. it WILL pay off.
